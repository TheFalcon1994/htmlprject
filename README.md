The Website is site where the game "History Game" can be mounted so that people can find
out about the game and see what updates are being created. The inspiration for the design
comes from the website: http://mordheim-cityofthedamned.com/en/news. Unfortunately, the 
content for the website has not been created yet so the content that is there is a
placeholder.

The Colour Scheme was chosen as it is easier to read the text as white on black for many
with different kinds of disabilities. E.g. My Brothers and my dylexia causes us to have 
problems with black on white. A friend, who wishes to be nameless, suffers from severe
eyesight problems and finds white on black to be better.
